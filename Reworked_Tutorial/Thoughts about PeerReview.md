# Thoughts on the Review of Eliane
I wanted to share my reflections on the review of Eliane and explain why I decided to completely rework everything.

Initially, I found myself in a bit of a bind. In my effort to address a real-life problem, I lost sight of what was truly important: creating a tutorial that effectively explains some new functions.

Eliane provided an exceptionally well-done review that opened my eyes to the chaos present in my previous tutorial.

Here are some key takeaways from her feedback:

1. Add error handling.
2. Avoid including such a large Excel file.
3. Instead of overwriting a file as a solution, create a new one.
4. Integrate the new functions within the task, rather than just providing links to the documentation.

As a result, I completely reworked the tutorials, even though it definitely extended the timeframe I originally anticipated for this project.

However, I believe the final tutorial is acceptable, and I am happy with the end result.
