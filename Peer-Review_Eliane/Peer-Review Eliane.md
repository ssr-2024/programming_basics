# Review of Openpyxl - Tutorial

### **First Impression**

The tutorial is exceptionally well-structured. From the outset, the introduction clearly outlines the package and its use cases, making its value immediately apparent. Additionally, the subsequent presentation of the package functions is organized in a way that enhances usability, which is incredibly helpful when tackling the problem below. Overall, I am truly impressed.

  

### **Possible Improvements**

While going through the tutorial, I noticed a couple of areas that could benefit from further clarification. Here are my suggestions for potential improvements:

  

1. I was uncertain whether I was expected to complete the existing template or to create a new file using it. Personally, I found it more comfortable to work in a separate .py file where I copied your template and implemented my solutions. This may simply be a matter of personal preference, but I thought it worth mentioning for your consideration.

  

2. Some aspects of the tutorial felt challenging for me, although I recognize that my programming skills are still developing. Overall, the difficulty level seems appropriate, but I believe there's a balance to be struck between engaging tasks and potentially unnecessary workload. For instance, I would recommend providing the package imports in advance rather than including it as a step in the tutorial. While it may not take much time, it could distract from the more critical exercises.

  
  
### **Final Thoughts**
I didn't find any other improvements needed, so I want to congratulate you once again on your wonderful work! It truly inspired me, especially in light of your feedback on my tutorial. Iâ€™ve decided to rework mine to better align with yours, allowing us to link them together.
I apologize for not being able to provide more constructive improvements to your tutorial; it was exceptionally well-structured. I hope you still found my small additions useful. 
Kind regards,
