### Entering Strings in Python

The sources cover various ways to create strings in Python, including:

- **String Literals:** These are strings enclosed in single quotes. For example: `'This is Alice's cat.'`
- **Double Quotes:** Strings can also be enclosed in double quotes, which is useful when the string contains a single quote. Example: `"This is Alice's cat."`
- **Escape Characters:** Escape characters allow you to include characters that would otherwise be invalid within a string. They consist of a backslash (`\`) followed by the desired character. For example, `\'` represents a single quote within a string enclosed by single quotes.
- **Raw Strings:** Preceding a string with an `r` creates a raw string, where Python ignores escape sequences. Example: `r'This is Carol's cat.'`
- **Multiline Strings:** These strings begin and end with triple single or double quotes, allowing for quotes, tabs, and newlines. Example:

    ```python
    print('''Dear Alice,

    Eve's cat was arrested for catnapping, burglary, and extortion.

    Sincerely,
    Bob''')
    ```

### Accessing and Manipulating Strings

The sources also describe different ways to access and manipulate strings:

- **Indexing and Slicing:** Strings can be indexed and sliced similarly to lists. Each character in a string has an index, starting at 0 for the first character. For instance, `spam[0]` yields the character "H" in the string "Hello world!". Slicing extracts a substring; `spam[0:5]` returns "Hello".
- **`in` and `not in` Operators:** These operators check if a substring is present in another string. For instance, `'Hello' in 'Hello World'` returns `True`.
- **String Methods:** Python offers various methods to manipulate strings. Some key methods include:

  - `upper()`, `lower()`: Convert the string to uppercase or lowercase.
    - `isupper()`, `islower()`: Check if the string is in uppercase or lowercase.
    - `isalpha()`, `isalnum()`, `isdecimal()`, `isspace()`, `istitle()`: Check different properties of the string.
    - `startswith()`, `endswith()`: Check if the string starts or ends with a specific substring.
    - `join()`, `split()`: `join()` joins a list of strings into a single string, using the specified separator. `split()` splits a string into a list based on the specified separator.
    - `rjust()`, `ljust()`, `center()`: Align the string within a given width to the right, left, or center.
    - `strip()`, `rstrip()`, `lstrip()`: Remove whitespace from both sides, the right side, or the left side of the string.

### Working with the Clipboard

The `pyperclip` module allows copying text to and pasting text from the clipboard. The functions `pyperclip.copy()` and `pyperclip.paste()` perform these operations.

### Projects

The sources include two projects that demonstrate string manipulation in Python:

- **Project: Password Locker:** This project creates a simple password management program.
- **Project: Adding Bullets to Wiki Markup:** This project creates a script that adds bullet points to text copied from the clipboard.

### Summary

Text is a common form of data, and Python comes with many helpful string methods to process the text stored in string values. You will make use of indexing, slicing, and string methods in almost every Python program you write.

### Questions

1. **What are escape characters?**  
   Escape characters allow you to include special characters in strings that would otherwise cause issues. They start with a backslash (`\`) followed by the character you want to "escape" or use in a special way, like `\n` for a newline or `\'` to include a single quote in a string enclosed by single quotes.

2. **What do the `\n` and `\t` escape characters represent?**  
   - `\n`: Represents a newline, which moves the text following it to the next line.
   - `\t`: Represents a tab, which adds a horizontal tab space in the text.

3. **How can you put a `\` backslash character in a string?**  
   You can include a backslash in a string by using a double backslash (`\\`). This tells Python to interpret it as a literal backslash character.

4. **The string value `"Howl's Moving Castle"` is a valid string. Why isn’t it a problem that the single quote character in the word Howl's isn’t escaped?**  
   Since the string is enclosed in double quotes, the single quote inside the string does not need to be escaped. Python interprets the single quote as a regular character.

5. **If you don’t want to put `\n` in your string, how can you write a string with newlines in it?**  
   You can use triple-quoted strings (with `'''` or `"""`) to write strings that include newlines directly. For example:
   ```python
   text = """This is a
   multi-line string
   that includes newlines."""
   ```

6. **What do the following expressions evaluate to?**
   - `'Hello world!'[1]`: `'e'` (the character at index 1)
   - `'Hello world!'[0:5]`: `'Hello'` (characters from index 0 up to, but not including, 5)
   - `'Hello world!'[:5]`: `'Hello'` (characters from the beginning up to index 5)
   - `'Hello world!'[3:]`: `'lo world!'` (characters from index 3 to the end)

7. **What do the following expressions evaluate to?**
   - `'Hello'.upper()`: `'HELLO'` (converts all characters to uppercase)
   - `'Hello'.upper().isupper()`: `True` (checks if the result is in uppercase, which it is)
   - `'Hello'.upper().lower()`: `'hello'` (converts to uppercase and then back to lowercase)

8. **What do the following expressions evaluate to?**
   - `'Remember, remember, the fifth of November.'.split()`: `['Remember,', 'remember,', 'the', 'fifth', 'of', 'November.']` (splits the string into a list of words by whitespace)
   - `'-'.join('There can be only one.'.split())`: `'There-can-be-only-one.'` (splits the string by whitespace and joins with hyphens)

9. **What string methods can you use to right-justify, left-justify, and center a string?**  
   - `rjust()`: Right-justifies the string within a specified width.
   - `ljust()`: Left-justifies the string within a specified width.
   - `center()`: Centers the string within a specified width.

10. **How can you trim whitespace characters from the beginning or end of a string?**  
    - `strip()`: Removes whitespace from both the beginning and end of the string.
    - `lstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the beginning (left side) only.
    - `rstrip()`: Removes whitespace from the end (right side) only.
