# Operators

Python provides a variety of operators for performing arithmetic calculations, comparisons, logical evaluations, membership checks, and identity checks. Each operator has a unique function and is commonly used in expressions to achieve specific results. 

## Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description                        | Example               |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------|:----------------------|
| `+`      | Addition                           | `3 + 2` results in `5` |
| `-`      | Subtraction                        | `5 - 2` results in `3` |
| `*`      | Multiplication                     | `4 * 3` results in `12` |
| `/`      | Division                           | `10 / 2` results in `5.0` |
| `//`     | Floor Division (integer division)  | `10 // 3` results in `3` |
| `**`     | Exponentiation                     | `2 ** 3` results in `8` |
| `%`      | Modulus (remainder of division)    | `10 % 3` results in `1` |

## Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description                        | Example                |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| `<`      | Less than                          | `3 < 5` results in `True` |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to              | `3 <= 3` results in `True` |
| `>`      | Greater than                       | `5 > 3` results in `True` |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to           | `5 >= 5` results in `True` |
| `==`     | Equal to                           | `4 == 4` results in `True` |
| `!=`     | Not equal to                       | `4 != 5` results in `True` |

## Logical Operators
| Operator | Description                        | Example                |
|:---------|:-----------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| `and`    | Logical AND (both conditions true) | `(5 > 3) and (4 > 2)` results in `True` |
| `or`     | Logical OR (either condition true) | `(5 > 3) or (2 > 4)` results in `True` |
| `not`    | Logical NOT (reverses condition)   | `not (5 > 3)` results in `False` |

## Membership Operators
| Operator | Description                         | Example                |
|:---------|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| `in`     | Checks if a value is in a sequence  | `'a' in 'apple'` results in `True` |
| `not in` | Checks if a value is not in a sequence | `'b' not in 'apple'` results in `True` |

## Identity Operators
| Operator | Description                          | Example                |
|:---------|:-------------------------------------|:-----------------------|
| `is`     | Checks if two variables refer to the same object | `a is b` |
| `is not` | Checks if two variables refer to different objects | `a is not b` |
