### Or important information and how to find it.


Listed below are the links to several tutorials, cheatsheets, etc.

In case all the new stuff in programming is overwhelming and you (meaning myself mostly) need a place to come to and find information that somehow managed to escape your brain during the lectures.

If someone other than me ends up finding this and comes across any mistakes, errors or missing information, please feel free to add, erase and/or correct whatever needs adding, erasing and/or correcting. :)

### NumPy

### - Link to Numpy-Tutorial: 
https://www.machinelearningplus.com/python/numpy-tutorial-part1-array-python-examples/

Q: *What is a NumPy?*

A:

    Numpy is the most basic and a powerful package for working with data in python.
    If you are going to work on data analysis or machine learning projects, then having a solid understanding of numpy is nearly mandatory.
    At the core, numpy provides the excellent ndarray objects, short for n-dimensional arrays.


### - Link to NumPy documentation:
https://numpy.org/doc/stable/#numpy-documentation

Q: *How is that different from the one above?*

A: I'm not completely sure it is much different at all, but it might be more comprehensive.

    The NumPy documentation provides comprehensive resources for users at all levels, including an Absolute Beginner’s Guide, a detailed User Guide for key concepts, and an API Reference that describes functions and modules. Additionally, there’s a Contributor’s Guide for those interested in contributing to the library. NumPy is essential for scientific computing in Python, offering support for multidimensional arrays and a range of mathematical operations.

### - Link to NumPy Style Guide
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

Q: *What does that thing do?*

A:

    This document describes the syntax and best practices for docstrings used with the numpydoc extension for Sphinx.

### Link to PandaCSV documentation:
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html

Q: *Aren't pandas those cute, cuddly animals?*:
<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="A cute panda sitting in a bamboo forest, with gentle sunlight filtering through the leaves..webp" alt="Cute panda in bamboo forest" width="100px">
</div>


A: As much as I'd love that, unfortunately, no. "Pandas" is short for "panel data". Below is a short overview of what PandasCSV can do:

    1. Function Description: This function is used to load CSV (comma-separated values) files into a DataFrame format, which is a central data structure in pandas.
    2. Parameter Overview: These include, among others, filepath_or_buffer (path to the file), delimiter (separator between values), header (defines whether a header row is used), and many others. Each parameter comes with a description and possible values.
    3. Return Values: The documentation also describes what read_csv returns, typically a DataFrame object.
